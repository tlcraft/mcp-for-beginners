# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Beginners - Study Guide

This study guide offers an overview of the repository structure and content for the "Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Beginners" curriculum. Use it to navigate the repository effectively and maximize the available resources.

## Repository Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized framework for facilitating interactions between AI models and client applications. Originally developed by Anthropic, MCP is now maintained by the broader MCP community through its official GitHub organization. This repository provides a detailed curriculum with hands-on code examples in C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript, tailored for AI developers, system architects, and software engineers.
