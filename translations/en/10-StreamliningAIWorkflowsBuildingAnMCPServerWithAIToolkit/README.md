## 🎯  Overview

Welcome to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Workshop**! This hands-on workshop combines two cutting-edge technologies to transform AI application development:

- **🔗 Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard for seamless AI-tool integration
- **🛠️ AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (AITK)**: Microsoft's powerful AI development extension

### 🎓 What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be skilled at building intelligent applications that connect AI models with real-world tools and services. From automated testing to custom API integrations, you'll gain practical skills to tackle complex business problems.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

### 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is the **"USB-C for AI"** — a universal standard that links AI models to external tools and data sources.

**✨ Key Features:**
- 🔄 **Standardized Integration**: Universal interface for connecting AI and tools
- 🏛️ **Flexible Architecture**: Supports local and remote servers via stdio/SSE transport
- 🧰 **Rich Ecosystem**: Combines tools, prompts, and resources in one protocol
- 🔒 **Enterprise-Ready**: Built with security and reliability in mind

**🎯 Why MCP Matters:**
Just like USB-C simplified cable connections, MCP removes the complexity of AI integrations. One protocol, endless possibilities.

### 🤖 AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (AITK)

Microsoft's flagship AI development extension that turns VS Code into an AI powerhouse.

**🚀 Core Capabilities:**
- 📦 **Model Catalog**: Access models from Azure AI, GitHub, Hugging Face, Ollama
- ⚡ **Local Inference**: ONNX-optimized execution on CPU/GPU/NPU
- 🏗️ **Agent Builder**: Visual AI agent creation with MCP integration
- 🎭 **Multi-Modal**: Supports text, vision, and structured outputs

**💡 Development Benefits:**
- Zero-configuration model deployment
- Visual prompt engineering
- Real-time testing playground
- Smooth MCP server integration
