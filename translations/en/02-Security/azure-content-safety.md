# Advanced MCP Security with Azure Content Safety

Azure Content Safety offers several powerful tools to enhance the security of your MCP implementations:

## Prompt Shields

Microsoft's AI Prompt Shields provide strong protection against both direct and indirect prompt injection attacks by:

1. **Advanced Detection**: Utilizing machine learning to spot malicious instructions hidden within content.
2. **Spotlighting**: Modifying input text to help AI systems differentiate between valid commands and external inputs.
3. **Delimiters and Datamarking**: Defining clear boundaries between trusted and untrusted data.
4. **Content Safety Integration**: Collaborating with Azure AI Content Safety to identify jailbreak attempts and harmful content.
5. **Continuous Updates**: Microsoft regularly updates protection methods to counter new threats.

## Implementing Azure Content Safety with MCP

This method offers multi-layered protection by:
- Scanning inputs before processing
- Validating outputs before returning them
- Using blocklists for known harmful patterns
- Leveraging Azure’s continuously updated content safety models
