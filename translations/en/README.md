- Time: 9:00 AM PST each day
- Location: Online – join from anywhere!

#### Day 1: MCP Productivity, DevTools, & Community

Focuses on empowering developers to incorporate MCP into their workflows and celebrates the vibrant MCP community. We’ll be joined by community members and partners like Arcade, Block, Okta, and Neon to explore how they collaborate with Microsoft to build an open, extensible MCP ecosystem. Expect real-world demos across VS Code, Visual Studio, GitHub Copilot, and popular community tools.
- Practical, context-driven developer workflows
- Community-led sessions and insights
Whether you’re new to MCP or already working with it, Day 1 will inspire and provide actionable takeaways.

#### Day 2: Build MCP Servers with Confidence

Designed for MCP builders. We’ll dive deep into implementation strategies and best practices for creating MCP servers and integrating MCP into AI workflows.

### Topics include:

- Building MCP Servers and integrating them into agent experiences
- Prompt-driven development
- Security best practices
- Using building blocks like Functions, ACA, and API Management
- Registry alignment and tooling (1P + 3P)
